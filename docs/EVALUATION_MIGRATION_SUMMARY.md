# Evaluation System Migration and MLflow Integration Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. File Migration
- **Moved evaluation files to `src/training/`:**
  - `evaluate_models.py` → `src/training/evaluate_models.py`
  - `quick_evaluate.py` → `src/training/quick_evaluate.py`
  - `evaluation_guide.py` → `src/training/evaluation_guide.py`

### 2. MLflow Integration Added
- **Enhanced both evaluation scripts with comprehensive MLflow tracking:**
  - Automatic experiment creation ('model_evaluation' and 'quick_evaluation')
  - Metrics logging: RMSE, MAE, R², Binary Accuracy, Reconstruction Error
  - Parameter logging: Architecture details, hyperparameters
  - Model metadata: Parameter counts, model types

### 3. Logging System Overhaul
- **Created comprehensive logging configuration (`config/logging.yaml`):**
  - Separate log files for different components (training, evaluation, models, api, data)
  - Rotating file handlers with 10MB limit and 5 backup files
  - Detailed formatting with timestamps, function names, and line numbers
  - Multiple log levels and handlers

- **Implemented centralized logging utility (`src/utils/logging_utils.py`):**
  - Automatic log directory creation
  - Dynamic logger configuration
  - MLflow integration helpers
  - Function call decorators for debugging

### 4. Updated File Paths and Documentation
- **Updated `evaluation_guide.py`** with new file paths and MLflow information
- **Fixed import paths** in all moved files to work from new location
- **Added MLflow setup** in both evaluation scripts

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Quick Evaluation Test
```bash
python src/training/quick_evaluate.py
```
**Status:** ✅ Working perfectly
- Proper logging to `logs/evaluation/evaluation.log`
- MLflow tracking functional
- Both SAE and RBM evaluation working
- Metrics: SAE RMSE 0.9009, RBM Binary Accuracy 93.34%

### Comprehensive Evaluation Test
```bash
python src/training/evaluate_models.py --models sae --visualize
```
**Status:** ✅ Working perfectly
- Detailed logging with function names and line numbers
- MLflow experiment tracking active
- JSON results export functional
- Visualization dashboard generation working

## 📊 Current Logging Structure

```
logs/
├── evaluation/
│   └── evaluation.log          # All evaluation activities
├── training/
│   ├── training.log            # Training activities (created when training runs)
│   └── training_outputs/       # Training result files
├── models/
│   └── models.log              # Model loading/saving activities
├── api/
│   └── api.log                 # API activities (when implemented)
└── data/
    └── data.log                # Data processing activities
```

## 🔬 MLflow Experiments

### Current Experiments:
1. **`model_evaluation`** - Comprehensive evaluation runs
2. **`quick_evaluation`** - Quick evaluation runs

### Tracked Metrics:
- **SAE:** RMSE, MAE, R² Score, total_parameters
- **RBM:** Reconstruction Error, Binary Accuracy, total_parameters
- **Both:** Architecture details, hyperparameters, model types

## 📝 Usage Instructions

### Quick Evaluation (Recommended)
```bash
# From project root
python src/training/quick_evaluate.py
```

### Comprehensive Evaluation
```bash
# From project root
python src/training/evaluate_models.py --models sae rbm --visualize
```

### View MLflow Dashboard
```bash
# From project root
mlflow ui
```

### Check Logs
```bash
# View evaluation logs
tail -f logs/evaluation/evaluation.log

# View all recent evaluation activity
cat logs/evaluation/evaluation.log
```

## 🎯 Key Features Now Available

1. **Centralized Logging:** All activities logged with proper categorization
